# Module 06.2: Monitor a Microsoft Fabric data warehouse

## Lab scenario

In Microsoft Fabric, a data warehouse provides a relational database for large-scale analytics. Data warehouses in Microsoft Fabric include dynamic management views that you can use to monitor activity and queries.

>**Note:** You need a Microsoft school or work account to complete this exercise. If you don’t have one, you can sign up for a trial of Microsoft Office 365 E3 or higher.

## Lab objectives
In this lab, you will perform:

- Create a sample data warehouse
- Explore dynamic management views
- Explore query insights

## Estimated timing: 30 minutes

### Task 1: Create a sample data warehouse

Now that you have a workspace, it’s time to create a data warehouse.

1. At the bottom left of the Power BI portal, select the **Power BI (1)** icon and switch to the **Data Warehouse (2)** experience.

1. On the Home page, select **Sample warehouse** and create a new data warehouse named **Warehouse<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false"/>**.

    >**Note:** After a minute or so, a new warehouse will be created and populated with sample data for a taxi ride analysis scenario.

### Task 2: Explore dynamic management views

Microsoft Fabric data warehouses include dynamic management views (DMVs), which you can use to identify current activity in the data warehouse instance.

1. In the **Warehouse<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false"/>** data warehouse page, in the **New SQL query** drop-down list, select **New SQL query**.

1. In the new blank query pane, enter the following Transact-SQL code to query the **sys.dm_exec_connections** DMV:

    ```Sql
    SELECT * FROM sys.dm_exec_connections;
    ```

1. Use the **▷ Run** button to run the SQL script and view the results, which include details of all connections to the data warehouse.

1. Modify the SQL code to query the **sys.dm_exec_sessions** DMV, like this:

    ```Sql
    SELECT * FROM sys.dm_exec_sessions;
    ```

1. Run the modified query and view the results, which show details of all authenticated sessions.

1. Modify the SQL code to query the **sys.dm_exec_requests** DMV, like this:

    ```Sql
    SELECT * FROM sys.dm_exec_requests;
    ```

1. Run the modified query and view the results, which show details of all requests being executed in the data warehouse.

1. Modify the SQL code to join the DMVs and return information about currently running requests in the same database, like this:

    ```Sql
    SELECT connections.connection_id,
    sessions.session_id, sessions.login_name, sessions.login_time,
    requests.command, requests.start_time, requests.total_elapsed_time
    FROM sys.dm_exec_connections AS connections
    INNER JOIN sys.dm_exec_sessions AS sessions
        ON connections.session_id=sessions.session_id
    INNER JOIN sys.dm_exec_requests AS requests
        ON requests.session_id = sessions.session_id
    WHERE requests.status = 'running'
        AND requests.database_id = DB_ID()
    ORDER BY requests.total_elapsed_time DESC;
    ```

1. Run the modified query and view the results, which show details of all running queries in the database (including this one).

1. In the **New SQL query** drop-down list, select **New SQL query** to add a second query tab. Then in the new empty query tab, run the following code:

    ```Sql
    WHILE 1 = 1
    SELECT * FROM Trip;
    ```

1. Leave the query running, and return to the tab containing the code to query the DMVs and re-run it. This time, the results should include the second query that is running in the other tab. Note the elapsed time for that query.

1. Wait a few seconds and re-run the code to query the DMVs again. The elapsed time for the query in the other tab should have increased.

1. Return to the second query tab where the query is still running and select X Cancel to cancel it.

1. Back on the tab with the code to query the DMVs, re-run the query to confirm that the second query is no longer running.

1. Close all query tabs.


### Task 3: Explore query insights

Microsoft Fabric data warehouses provide query insights - a special set of views that provide details about the queries being run in your data warehouse.

1. In the **Warehouse<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false"/>** data warehouse page, in the **New SQL query** drop-down list, select **New SQL query**.

1. In the new blank query pane, enter the following Transact-SQL code to query the **exec_requests_history** view:

    ```Sql
    SELECT * FROM queryinsights.exec_requests_history;
    ```

1. Use the **▷ Run** button to run the SQL script and view the results, which include details of previously executed queries.

1. Modify the SQL code to query the **frequently_run_queries** view, like this:

    ```Sql
    SELECT * FROM queryinsights.frequently_run_queries;
    ```

1. Run the modified query and view the results, which show details of frequently run queries.

1. Modify the SQL code to query the **long_running_queries** view, like this:

    ```Sql
    SELECT * FROM queryinsights.long_running_queries;
    ```

1. Run the modified query and view the results, which show details of all queries and their durations.
