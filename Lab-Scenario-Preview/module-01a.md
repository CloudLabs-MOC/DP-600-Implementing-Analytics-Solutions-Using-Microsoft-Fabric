# Lab Scenario Preview: Module 01a: Ingest Data in Data Flows (Gen2) in MS Fabric

## Lab overview

In this lab, you will learn how to explore and understand the fundamental elements of Dataflows (Gen2) without delving into the complexities that may arise in an enterprise-level solution. The primary aim of this hands-on session is to provide you with a foundational understanding of Dataflows (Gen2) by introducing key components in a simplified context.

### Objectives
  
After completing this lab, you will be able to:

- Create a Lakehouse
